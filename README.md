BMI Prediction Machine Learning Pipeline
A comprehensive machine learning pipeline for predicting BMI changes in patients on olanzapine treatment. This repository provides end-to-end functionality for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

ðŸŽ¯ Overview
This project implements a modular ML pipeline to predict significant BMI increases (>5%) in patients receiving olanzapine treatment. The pipeline includes:

-Data preprocessing and feature engineering

-Multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost)

-Comprehensive evaluation with SHAP explainability

-Automated visualization and reporting

-Configurable experiments via YAML files
